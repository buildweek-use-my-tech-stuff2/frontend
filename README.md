Project Description - 

Use My Tech Stuff is a high-end equipment sharing marketplace. Members can rent a variety of gear from a community of equipment owners across the US. Youâ€™ll be able to choose from a diverse selection of cameras, laptops, speakers, monitors, and more in whatever city you want. At the same time, if you list your equipment, you can earn extra money to offset the costs of owning these professional tools.
